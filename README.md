# First_Test_Site


First attempt working with Drupal enviroment


Initial steps taken by me to get a working site up was to download a server/database management system.


I choose to use XAMPP


Second step was using phpMyAdmin to create the database for the soon to be created site


Downloaded the most current Drupal enviroment zip file


Added the site to XAMPP folder


Used the very useful quick startup that Drupal has built-in


Begain using the various tools to create both new custom content types and premade content types to build the skeleton of a basic site
